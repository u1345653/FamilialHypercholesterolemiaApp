## Purpose:
- Repo contains code, which instantiates a Python/Flask framework based web application, which physician's can use to calculate a 9-Person Pedigree's likelihood of either having or developing Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH).
- User's are presented the option to input a series of variables, each of which are used to calculate the individuals risk, as well as the entire family pedigree's risk, of developing FH.
- User input variables are:
-- Sex
-- Age
-- LDL Cholesterol Level
-- Total-Cholesterol Level
-- Coronary Artery Disease Status (Prevelent, Non-Prevelent, Unknown)
-- Coronary Artery Disease Age (age at time of diagnosis)
-- Tendon Xanthoma Status (Prevelent, Non-Prevelent, Unknown)
