# UofU2021Capstone-Work
AS OF 9.24.21 - JAVA CODE PERFORMS THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIIONS: 
  1) TAKES USER INPUT FOR ALL MAJOR VARIABLES IN PENETRANCE FUNCTION (NEED TO HAVE DESIRED PARAMETERS SPECIFIED BY DR. WARE AS A NEXT STEP)
  2) GENERATES 6-MAJOR PENETRANCE FUNCTION OUTPUTS FOR 1 FAMILY PEDIGREE (NEED TO REVISIT TOT-C BEING USED IN PLACE OF LDL-C WHEN IT HASN'T BEEN PROVIDED; LOOK AT PYTHON CODE!)
  3) GENERATES A BINARY TABLE WITH 511 ROWS (NEED TO LOOK INTO CONVERTING TO MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY W/ 'X' COLUMNS FOR AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS)
  4) GENERATES STRING LIKELIHOOD (REVISIT CODE -- WAS MADE PRIOR TO HAVING REST OF AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS COMPLETED)


TODO(): 
1) VISIT LOGIC USED IN PYTHON TO DETERMINE WHEN TOT-C IS USED TO GENERATE CHOLESTEROL PENETRANCE VAL (WHEN LDL-C IS NOT PROVIDED?)
2) MAP BINARY TABLE TO THE MAJOR AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
